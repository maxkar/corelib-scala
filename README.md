# Corelib Libraries

A collection of small faceted/modular libraries for most common tasks like
working with json, running webserver or creating a desktop app.

## Interesting Examples

 * `json/samples/streaming-formatter` - json formatter reusing bits
   from the standard library. It uses coroutines to allow "asynchronous"
   (in relation to the main formatting code) input-output.
